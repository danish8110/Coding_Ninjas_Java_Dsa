Figure out the correct statement


    class Car{
        String color;
        double price;
    }

    public class CarUse {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Car c = new Car();
        //Figure out the correct statement to set color of the car object referred by c to “white”
       }
    }
    
    
 This problem has only one correct answer
         c->color = “white”
         Car.color = “white”
-->      c.color = "white";



Solution:
        c.color = "white";
